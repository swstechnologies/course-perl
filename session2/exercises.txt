## Exercise 2: Hashes
1. Create a hash to store the names and ages of three people. Print each person's name and age.

## Exercise 3: Subroutines
1. Write a subroutine that takes two numbers as arguments and returns their sum. Call the subroutine and print the result.
2. Write a subroutine that takes a string as an argument and returns the string in reverse. Call the subroutine and print the result.

## Exercise 4: String Functions
1. Create a string variable with the value "Hello, World!". Use a string function to find the length of the string and print it.
2. Create a string variable with the value "Perl Programming". Use a string function to convert the string to uppercase and print it.
3. Create a string variable with the value "  Trim me  ". Use a string function to remove the leading and trailing whitespace and print the result.

## Exercise 5: Array Functions
1. Create an array with the values (3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9). Use an array function to sort the array in ascending order and print the result.
2. Create an array with the values ("apple", "banana", "cherry"). Use an array function to add "date" to the end of the array and print the result.
3. Create an array with the values ("red", "green", "blue"). Use an array function to remove the first element of the array and print the result.

## Exercise 6: Hash Functions
1. Create a hash with the keys "apple", "banana", and "cherry" and their corresponding values "red", "yellow", and "red". Use a hash function to get a list of all the keys and print them.
2. Create a hash with the keys "cat", "dog", and "bird" and their corresponding values "meow", "bark", and "tweet". Use a hash function to check if the key "dog" exists in the hash and print the result.
